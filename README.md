# finalproject

I've been working on this for months :)



a web-based project created using Django to display multiple results and visualization of my social network analysis using Jaccard Similarity 
for co-topics classification and Pagerank Centrality to find the most influential users in several networks.






ps: I'm not uploading the .ipynb notebooks that contain the project analysis
